This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.

For information about access to this release, see the access request page.

To ensure that VM resources are available when your Vertex AI Workbench instances need them, you can use Compute Engine reservations. Reservations provide a high level of assurance in obtaining capacity for Compute Engine zonal resources.

Limitations and requirements
All limitations of Compute Engine reservations apply when Vertex AI Workbench instances consume reservations. See How reservations work.

In addition, when using reservations with Vertex AI Workbench instances, the following limitations and requirements apply:

Consuming Compute Engine reservations with Vertex AI Workbench instances is in private preview. To request access, see the access request page.

Committed use discounts don't apply.

Using reservations with Vertex AI Workbench is only available through the Notebooks API. Using reservations with Vertex AI Workbench by using the Google Cloud console isn't supported.

Before you begin
In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

Note: If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.
Go to project selector

Enable the Compute Engine and Notebooks APIs.

Required roles
To get the permissions that you need to use reservations with Vertex AI Workbench instances, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

Compute Admin (roles/compute.admin)
Notebooks Admin (roles/notebooks.admin)
For more information about granting roles, see Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations.

You might also be able to get the required permissions through custom roles or other predefined roles.

Create a reservation
Create a Compute Engine reservation. It can be a single-project reservation or a shared reservation. For more information, see the following documents:

Create a reservation for a single project
Create a shared reservation
The reservation can include GPU accelerators.

Use a reservation with a new instance
You can add your reservation when creating a new Vertex AI Workbench instance by using the REST API.

Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements:

PROJECT_ID: your project ID
LOCATION: the zone where your instance is located
INSTANCE_NAME: the name of your instance
MACHINE_TYPE: the machine type of your instance
RESERVATION_TYPE: the type of reservation; must be RESERVATION_ANY or RESERVATION_SPECIFIC
RESERVATION_NAME: the name of your reservation when using the RESERVATION_SPECIFIC type
For reservations in the same project, you can use the reservation ID.
For reservations in a different project, you must use the full reservation path.
HTTP method and URL:



POST https://notebooks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/instances?instanceId=INSTANCE_NAME
Request JSON body:



{
  "gce_setup": {
    "machine_type": "MACHINE_TYPE",
    "reservation_affinity": {
      "consume_reservation_type": "RESERVATION_TYPE",
      "key": "compute.googleapis.com/reservation-name",
      "values": ["RESERVATION_NAME"]
    }
  }
}
To send your request, choose one of these options:

curl
PowerShell
Note: The following command assumes that you have logged in to the gcloud CLI with your user account by running gcloud init or gcloud auth login , or by using Cloud Shell, which automatically logs you into the gcloud CLI . You can check the currently active account by running gcloud auth list.
Save the request body in a file named request.json, and execute the following command:



curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \
     -d @request.json \
     "https://notebooks.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/instances?instanceId=INSTANCE_NAME"
If successful, the response body contains an instance of Operation.
To use any reservation,



{
  "gce_setup": {
    "machine_type": "MACHINE_TYPE",
    "reservation_affinity": {
      "consume_reservation_type": "RESERVATION_ANY"
    }
  }
}
Stop using your reservation
To stop using your reservation, you can delete your reservation.

If you want to continue using your reservation with other resources, but don't want your existing Vertex AI Workbench instance to use it, you must delete the instance.

Billing
Reserved Compute Engine VM resources are billed by Vertex AI Workbench while the Vertex AI Workbench instance is running, and are billed by Compute Engine when the VM resources aren't being used by Vertex AI Workbench.
